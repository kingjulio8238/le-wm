**Abstract:** Joint Embedding Predictive Architectures (JEPAs) offer a compelling framework for learning world models in compact latent spaces, yet existing methods remain fragile, relying on complex multi-term losses, exponential moving averages, pretrained encoders, or auxiliary supervision to avoid representation collapse. In this work, we introduce LeWorldModel (LeWM), the first JEPA that trains stably end-to-end from raw pixels using only two loss terms: a next-embedding prediction loss and a regularizer enforcing Gaussian-distributed latent embeddings. This reduces tunable loss hyperparameters from six to one compared to the only existing end-to-end alternative. With ~15M parameters trainable on a single GPU in a few hours, LeWM plans up to 48× faster than foundation-model-based world models while remaining competitive across diverse 2D and 3D control tasks. Beyond control, we show that LeWM's latent space encodes meaningful physical structure through probing of physical quantities. Surprise evaluation confirms that the model reliably detects physically implausible events.

## Using the code
This codebase builds on [stable-worldmodel](https://github.com/galilai-group/stable-worldmodel) for environment management, planning, and evaluation, and [stable-pretraining](https://github.com/galilai-group/stable-pretraining) for training. Together they reduce this repository to its core contribution: the model architecture and training objective.

**Installation:**
```bash
uv venv --python=3.10
source .venv/bin/activate
uv pip install stable-worldmodel[train,env]
```

## Data

Datasets use the HDF5 format for fast loading. Download the data from the [Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1r31os0d4-rR0mdHc7OlY_e5nh3XT4r4e?usp=sharing) and decompress with:

```bash
tar --zstd -xvf archive.tar.zst
```

Place the extracted `.h5` files under `$STABLEWM_HOME` (defaults to `~/.stable-wm/`). You can override this path:
```bash
export STABLEWM_HOME=/path/to/your/storage
```

Dataset names are specified without the `.h5` extension. For example, `config/train/data/pusht.yaml` references `pusht_expert_train`, which resolves to `$STABLEWM_HOME/pusht_expert_train.h5`.

## Training

`jepa.py` contains the PyTorch implementation of LeWM. Training is configured via [Hydra](https://hydra.cc/) config files under `config/train/`.

Before training, set your WandB `entity` and `project` in `config/train/lewm.yaml`:
```yaml
wandb:
  config:
    entity: your_entity
    project: your_project
```

To launch training:
```bash
python train.py data=pusht
```

Checkpoints are saved to `$STABLEWM_HOME` upon completion.

For baseline scripts, see the stable-worldmodel [scripts](https://github.com/galilai-group/stable-worldmodel/tree/main/scripts/train) folder.

## Planning

Evaluation configs live under `config/eval/`. Set the `policy` field to the checkpoint path **relative to `$STABLEWM_HOME`**, without the `_object.ckpt` suffix:

```bash
# ✓ correct
python eval.py --config-name=pusht.yaml policy=pusht/lewm

# ✗ incorrect
python eval.py --config-name=pusht.yaml policy=pusht/lewm_object.ckpt
```

## Pretrained Checkpoints

Pre-trained checkpoints are available on [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1r31os0d4-rR0mdHc7OlY_e5nh3XT4r4e). Download the checkpoint archive and place the extracted files under `$STABLEWM_HOME/`.

</div>

## Loading a checkpoint

Each tar archive contains two files per checkpoint:
- `<name>_object.ckpt` — a serialized Python object for convenient loading; this is what `eval.py` and the `stable_worldmodel` API use
- `<name>_weight.ckpt` — a weights-only checkpoint (`state_dict`) for cases where you want to load weights into your own model instance

To load the object checkpoint via the `stable_worldmodel` API:

```python
import stable_worldmodel as swm

# Load the cost model (for MPC)
cost = swm.policy.AutoCostModel('pusht/lewm')
```

Both functions accept:
- `run_name` — checkpoint path **relative to `$STABLEWM_HOME`**, without the `_object.ckpt` suffix
- `cache_dir` — optional override for the checkpoint root (defaults to `$STABLEWM_HOME`)

The returned module is in `eval` mode with its PyTorch weights accessible via `.state_dict()`.

## LeHarness: Optimized Planning Infrastructure

LeHarness wraps LeWM in an optimized planning infrastructure that reduces planning latency from **1,310ms to 89ms** (15x speedup) while maintaining 94% success rate on PushT.

### What LeHarness Does

LeHarness makes LeWM plan **faster** without changing the model. It optimizes the CEM planning loop that searches for good actions:

1. **Budget reduction** — Finds the minimum CEM samples × iterations that maintains accuracy (4.7x fewer forward passes)
2. **Compiled inference** — `torch.compile` with CUDA graphs on the predictor transformer (3.6x per-call speedup)
3. **Cached encoding** — Encodes observation and goal images once per planning step, not per CEM iteration
4. **Pre-allocated buffers** — Eliminates tensor allocation in the autoregressive rollout loop

### Quick Start (on RunPod RTX 4090)

```bash
# Setup
pip install "stable-worldmodel[train,env]"
export STABLEWM_HOME=/workspace/data

# Use the pipeline
python -c "
from harness.pipeline import PlanningPipeline
import numpy as np

pipeline = PlanningPipeline('pusht/lejepa', num_samples=128, n_steps=15)
pipeline.warmup()  # one-time compilation (~30s)

# Plan from images
obs = np.random.randint(0, 255, (224, 224, 3), dtype=np.uint8)
goal = np.random.randint(0, 255, (224, 224, 3), dtype=np.uint8)
action = pipeline.plan(obs, goal)

print(f'Action: {action}')
print(f'Timing: {pipeline.get_timing_summary()}')
"
```

### Reproducing Results

```bash
# Run the final benchmark
python scripts/final_benchmark.py --policy pusht/lejepa

# Run the standard eval (50 episodes)
python eval.py --config-name=pusht policy=pusht/lejepa solver=cem \
    solver.num_samples=128 solver.n_steps=15 solver.topk=25 eval.num_eval=50

# Run the budget sweep (finds optimal CEM config)
python scripts/sweep_budget.py --policy pusht/lejepa --dry-run
```

| Success rate | 98% | **94%** | -4pp |
| Forward passes/step | 45,000 | **9,600** | 4.7x |
